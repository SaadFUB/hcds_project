# Alzheimers HCDS Project Brainstorming

## Predictability

1. Can we predict Alzheimer's diagnosis based on non-invasive factors?
2. Can we predict the MMSE score of a patient? (changing target label from Alzheimers Diagnosis to Cognitive Impairment)
3. Can we identify patients at high risk of developing Alzheimer's?

## Fairness

4. Is the prediction model fair across gender and ethnicity?
5. Does model performance vary by education level or age group?

## Explainability

6. What are the most important risk factors for Alzheimer's in this dataset?
7. How do lifestyle factors differ between patients with and without Alzheimer's?

## Correlations

8. Is there an association between cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's?
9. Does sleep quality mediate the link between depression and cognitive scores?
