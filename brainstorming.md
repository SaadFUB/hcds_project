# Alzheimers HCDS Project Brainstorming

## Predictability

1. Can we predict Alzheimer's diagnosis based on non-invasive factors?
2. Can we identify patients at high risk of developing Alzheimer's?

## Fairness

3. Is the prediction model fair across gender and ethnicity?
4. Does model performance vary by education level or age group?

## Correlations

5. Is there an association between cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's?
6. Does sleep quality mediate the link between depression and cognitive scores?
