## Interview 1 (22:43)  
*Consent given*

**Have you ever used any apps or tools to track your well-being?**  
- Smart watch app to check well-being.

**If yes, what were your expectations when using such tools?**  
- Information reflecting on how to improve health and general self-reflection.

**Who do you think would use an app like this?**  
- Recommendations about how to avoid problems.

### Homepage  
**Q: What do you think you can do here?**  
- I know why I would use it and I feel very satisfied with my knowledge of what to do.

**Task 1: You now want to make a prediction - how would you proceed?**  
- I would input some information and feels very clear.

### Making a Prediction  
**Q: What do you think you can do here?**  
- Make assessments and receive feedback.  
- Need to think a little bit.

**Q: Are any of the input fields unclear?**  
- MMSE score — doesn’t know what it is (real physician would know).  
- Function assessment — doesn’t know what it is either.  
- Sliders aren’t placed in a visually pleasing way; could be more beautiful.

**Task 2: Please fill in the patient’s data and make a prediction.**  
- I don’t know what model to choose because I’m just a physician.  
- Gave her feedback that models have tradeoff between explanation and accuracy, so she should read methodology first and then pick a model.  
- She’d like to run all models at once and be able to compare them at the end. She looked distraught here.  
- Picking a model is NOT a symptom. It shouldn’t be in symptoms field in her opinion. But she is not a physician.

### Understanding the Prediction  
**Task 3: Now try to understand the prediction shown without clicking further. What do you understand from it?**  
- Need for information written on the page to understand the context.  
- We explained context and then she doubled down on wanting that in writing.

**Task 4: Can you interpret the graphs to understand why this prediction was made? Is the text explanation helpful?**  
- Descriptions of graphs would be appreciated because she doesn’t know how to interpret the graph.  
- Wants more text about the 7 most influential factors, user/patient values, etc.  
- She has too many questions and doesn’t like having that many questions.  
- She likes SHAP values, but wants stuff in bold. Too much text. She is exhausted.  
- Called text too poetic, wants more down to earth language that is understandable.  
- She wants bigger circles when Alzheimer’s is more likely and smaller ones when less likely.

**Task 5: Does this result lead you to take any specific action (e.g., referral, patient education)? If so, what?**  
- She isn’t able to make decision because she is confused about data interpretation.

### Understanding the Model  
**Task 7: Now you want to understand how the model works. Where do you expect to find this information?**  
- Somewhere else it should say to go to methodology section (either in input area or output area).  
- Methodology section is not self-revealing; she wouldn’t go there naturally without being told to.

**Q: What do you think about this page?**  
- The page itself is awesome. Fantastic.

**Is there anything missing that you would expect to see in this kind of app?**  
- Nothing. She said she wanted recommendations after saying nothing when pressured to say something.  
- We explained that recommendations was in initial design and she got why we scrapped it but also could see why it is useful.

*Consent given*

**Have you ever used any apps or tools to track your well-being?**  
- Tracking health and menstrual cycle.

**Who do you think would use an app like this?**

**Q: What do you think you can do here?**  
- Nice name.  
- Nice colors.  
- Easy to read.  
- Warning is perfect to grab attention.

### Making a Prediction  
**Q: Are any of the input fields unclear?**  
- BMI but if she is physician she’d know.  
- Diet quality 1-10 is unclear.  
- Sleep quality she thought it was hours (why not include 0).  
- Overall she is very impressed by our information.  
- She’s also not sure which model to select.

### Understanding the Prediction  
**Task 3: Now try to understand the prediction shown without clicking further. What do you understand from it?**  
- She didn’t get the 94% meaning (is it risk?).

### Understanding the Model  
**Task 7: Now you want to understand how the model works. Where do you expect to find this information?**  
- She’d like to see the methodology page linked to the 94% score.

**What did you like (or dislike) most about the app?**  
- Likes explanations and is most focused on the visuals of the prediction result. She would like as much focus on that as possible as that is the key aspect of the website.
