## 2) Decision Scenario
- **Models**: discussing potential use of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network
- **Real-World Decision**: checking whether people are likely to get Alzheimers and fairness between race and ethnicity
- **Constraints**: We are concentrated on the ethical constraints. There are protected attributes in the dataset.
- **Requirements**: Models must be interpretable for medical experts, accurate in predictions, and regularly audited for fairness across demographic groups.
- **Stakes**: Misclassification or bias in the model can cause harm to patients, delay treatment, and perpetuate systemic healthcare inequalities.
